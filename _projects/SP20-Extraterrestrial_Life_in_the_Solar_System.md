title: Extraterrestrial Life in the Solar System
desc: The motivation to make this game was to educate our players about how likely an extra terrestrial being would be out there in our solar system according to science. Our portrayal is in no way realistic aesthetically but it is intended to be more "game-like". However, the science behind it is true. Our vision has been matched with the game we have come up with. We managed to combine science with games just as we envisioned.
