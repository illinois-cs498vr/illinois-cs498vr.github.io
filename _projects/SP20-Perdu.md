title: Perdu
desc: Given a sponsor’s desire to give students a more interactive French learning experience, Perdu is a VR quest based game targeted for Oculus Go involving many different situations one might come across in France. Set in a 1960s French Village, the player finds themselves alone in a French park with no recollection of where or who they are. Through a series of interactions, the player finds out the way “home” is by taking the train out of the city and then goes about collecting enough money for a train ticket.
