title: ECE 329 VR Lab
desc: Implement the boundary condition lab ECE329 VR lab. To visualize the boundary condition, students can change factors like medium permittivity, surface charge E1 direction and length, and see how they will affect E2. Students can also see the real component and tangential component of E1 and E2, and the lab will show theyâ€™ll always have the same tangential component .
