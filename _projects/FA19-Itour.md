desc: Our goal for the final project was to build an interactive UIUC VR campus tour. The application gives you full liberty to explore the hottest spots on campus the way you want to. It gives you directions to various spots on campus that you can explore in the order that you want. We also provided a guide bot that gives you info about the places as you visit them. BONUS!!! You can also play a game of hoops!!
