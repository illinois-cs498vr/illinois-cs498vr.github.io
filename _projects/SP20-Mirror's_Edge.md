title: Mirror's Edge
desc: This project is inspired by the Mirror's Edge video game series. Those games involve performing parkour through a city. Some of the mechanics in those games are jumping, wall running, and sliding. We have done our best to implement those mechanics in our project and incorporate the level design into a cityscape.
