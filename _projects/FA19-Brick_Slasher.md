title: Brick Slasher
desc: A VR Fruit Ninja-like game where the goal is to slash all bricks before they hit the ground with your wielded katanas. Your score will increase with every brick hit, and you will lose one of your three starting lives with every  block missed. Hit ice bricks to help slow down the incoming bricks.
