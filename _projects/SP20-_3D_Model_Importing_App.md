title:  3D Model Importing App
desc: The user can import 3D models into the app to take a closer look at the object by looking around in the room that the object is imported in. When the user imports the object, the app will know the dimension of the object to choose which room has the correct size for it.  The user can move in the room by pressing left, right, up and down keyword as well as scrolling the mouse to turn around. If the user wants to see the object from above, he or she can press the ctrl key and simultaneously scroll the mouse.
