title: CITL VR-ification ANTH 250
desc: Our sponsored VR project is a learning game where the user can explore a Pre-Bactrian archaeological site called Padjart Alkmy. It is designed around a set of learning objectives, and split into stages corresponding to each objective. The user will have to complete one stage before proceeding to the next. At each stage there is an audio lecture that the user has to listen to, and some supplementary material that the user should examine. By the end of the learning game, the user should have completed all the learning objectives.
