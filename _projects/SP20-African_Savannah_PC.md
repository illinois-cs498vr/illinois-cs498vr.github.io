title: African Savannah PC
desc: The VR frontend for a much larger project that is meant to allow users to test IoT devices in a simulated environment. This game aims to simulate an African savanna where ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿users can attach IoT devices to animals and receive information about the animals such as position and current action. Due to Covid-19, the project was split into two parts - VR and PC. Therefore, there are two zip files, githubs and youtube videos. Note: GitHub may be private due to the Sponsor/Professor Matthew Caesar
