title: Dental Dog
desc: Dental Dog is an interactive 3D model of a canine skull and teeth, used to teach veterinary dentistry to current veterinary students and as a supplemental teaching tool in a MOOK. The project is built as a WebGL application. The application provides various features that allow the user to understand the internal structures of a canine skull and teeth. The user can interact with the teeth and learn the names of each tooth. They can learn the differences between each tooth in terms of number of roots and the direction they arch toward. They can rotate the skull to observe from different angles.  The skull can be switched between an opaque and transparent mode (where the tooth roots and tooth coloring can be viewed), and the jaw can be opened and closed, to observe the underlying structures.
