Paddle boarding is becoming an increasing popular activity amongst adults, and as more of the population becomes 65 years older, a need for quantifying the benefits of popular activities on neuromuscular functio will be required. Given the constrains with data collection of human movement and neural activity on water, this project seeks to use virtual reality in unison with whole-body motion capture and high-density EEG, to provide a unique testbed for exploring behavioral and neural changes due to exposure to paddle boarding.
