title: SlenderVR
desc: The goal of our project was to create a horror experience in VR. The game starts with the player waking up in the midst of an abandoned ruins. The ruins is surrounded by tall mountains, and therefore impossible to escape without a helicopter pickup. However, the playerâ€™s cannot call for pickup since his radio is broken and must search the ruins to find the parts required to fix the radio. Slenderman lurks around the ruins and is actively trying to kill the player. The player must successfully find the parts required and call for rescue before getting killed by Slenderman.
