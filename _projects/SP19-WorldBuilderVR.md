 Our project was created to extend the 3D software used by architects on the 2D interaface of computers into the 3D space of VR. 
 Our main focus for the project was to have features similar to high level architecture softwares such as Rhino where architects 
 use basic shapes to model building and city designs. For this project, we wanted to use basic rectangular shapes to implement 
 this high level aspect.
