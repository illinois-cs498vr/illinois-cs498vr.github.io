title: KARSIM Countryside
desc:  Our team was tasked with creating an ideal scenario to demonstrate the usefulness of our sponsor’s technology. We were asked to create the scenario in which you are driving on a long country road and you would like to pass a car/truck but you can’t see around the car/truck to see if a car is coming your way. We were also asked to create the scenario in which you are trying to make a left turn but you cannot see around the car in front of you. These scenarios would ideally show off a technology that allows you to see around cars when in these scenarios to decrease accidents.
