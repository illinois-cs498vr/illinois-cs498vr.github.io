title: Amusement Park
desc: This is a FPS game that simulates an amusement park. The player sits in a cart which will move automatically inside the playground. There are two thematically opposite scenes. The first is a fairy tale scene, and the second is a horror scene. If the player shoot 5 targets then he/she will get level up and targets start to move. If the player is caught by any targets, then GAME OVER...
