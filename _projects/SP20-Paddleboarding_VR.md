title: Paddleboarding VR
desc: Making use of a rotating platform and VR controller “oar”, the user can paddleboard through different VR environments. As of completion of our project, these include the original island layout, a rainforest river, a cave maze, an icy tundra, and an aquatic stadium for practice. These layouts are intended for a user going through physical therapy, as simulating a paddle boarding experience is likely more immersive than going through repetitive exercises.
