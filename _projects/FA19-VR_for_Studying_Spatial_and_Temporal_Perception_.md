title: VR for Studying Spatial and Temporal Perception 
desc: This is a sponsored project. This project is two experiments that take place in a city environment. The first experiment is has the "player" walk down a straight corridor,  once the player hits an intersection, they input how many seconds they perceive it took to travel down the street. The second experiment was supposed to track the path  of player and check if he would take signs to move in certain directions or not. Our sponsor did not give us the detail for the signs, so the player can only free roam around the city.
