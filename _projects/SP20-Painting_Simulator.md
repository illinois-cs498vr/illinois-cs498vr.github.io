title: Painting Simulator
desc: We have two modes: Speed Painting and Free Painting Free painting lets you pick a landscape that you want to paint in and you can spawn differently shaped/sized canvases and you can paint whatever you want. In speed painting, you select an image that you want to paint then try to copy it onto the canvas in the scene. You hit start and a timer times you, and when you hit finish a score will appear rating the accuracy of your painting.
