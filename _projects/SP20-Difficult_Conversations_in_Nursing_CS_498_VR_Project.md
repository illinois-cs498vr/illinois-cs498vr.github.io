title: Difficult Conversations in Nursing CS 498 VR Project
desc: Difficult Conversations in Nursing is a multi-semester sponsored project that simulates the different conversations a nursing student may face in their field. During semester 1, the students built the first rendition of the to-be VR project, with VR plans unfortunately being scrapped due to COVID-19 limitations. As well, the students designed a hospital floor with a waiting room, hospital room, and childrenâ€™s hospital room for different conversational settings. As well, the students implemented the IBM Watson speech-to-text API along with the LUIS language-interpreting API to lay the groundwork for oral interactions with NUCs down the future of the application.
