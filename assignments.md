## Lab Information ##
The lab computers are Falcon Northwest PCs with dual 27-inch monitors, NVidia GeForce Titan Black or 1080 graphics cards, Windows 10, Visual Studio, and [standard EWS-provided software](https://it.engineering.illinois.edu/ews-windows-lab-software). Each computer has an Oculus Rift CV1 (donated by Oculus/Facebook), an XBox controller, and two Touch Controllers.

If you choose to develop outside the lab, you should test and experience your work at least once on the lab computers, as we will also grade your work there.

Unfortunately, we have only 20 workstations and over 200 students. Therefore, you should start early on assignments and work in the lab during less popular times. Unless announced otherwise, the lab is available 24/7.

## Assignment Policies ##

- Read the submission instructions in each handout carefully!
- You must work in pairs on all assignments. We recommend using Piazza to find a group.
- We will accept assignments only up to two days late, with a 20% penalty.

## Regrade Requests ##
To submit a regrade request:

- Create a private Piazza post with the `regrade` tag.
- Include a brief explanation of why you think your grade is incorrect.
- You must submit regrade requests within one week after we release grades on a given assignment.

For MPs:

- The course staff will regrade MPs.
- Include NetIDs for both you **and your partner**.
- Major issues (e.g. a submission issue resulted in a zero) have priority over minor issues (e.g. lost points on one small feature of the MP).
- We may not regrade your work until after all MPs have finished.

For exams:

- The course instructor will regrade exams.
- Include a brief description of the question.

## Academic Integrity ##
You should be familiar with the Student Code [definitions on academic integrity](http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-401.html). We expect you to abide by them.
