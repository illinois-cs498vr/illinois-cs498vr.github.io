You and a partner must review three VR experiences according to the [Oculus Best Practices Guide](https://developer.oculus.com/design/latest/concepts/book-bp/).
These experiences can be from the Oculus Store, the Steam Store, or a student demo from the CS498 `V:` drive's "Student Projects" folder.
This assignment is meant to turn you into a VR snob.
Pick apart every little design decision you can think of.

### Reviews

Each review must focus on the following four categories:

* Graphical/Aesthetic Quality
* User Interface
* Movement
* Immersion/Presence

For each category, write a short paragraph that describes what that particular experience does well and what it does poorly in regards to that category.
Also, include at least two suggestions on how to improve the experience.
Aim for about 150-300 words per review.

We will grade your assignment according to how well you can justify your answer with specific examples from the Best Practices Guide.

### Citations

You must support your observations with citations from the Best Practices Guide. Provide section names and direct quotes.

We provide an example:
> The menu feels too close to the eyes which may cause discomfort.  Instead, UI elements should be incorporated into the virtual world as 3D objects. [1]

In footnotes:
> [1] Vision -> Comfortable Viewing Distances: ...should be rendered at least 0.5 meters away...

### Submission

Submit your reviews on Compass as a double-spaced PDF. The filename should contain the NetIDs of both people in the group, separated by underscores (e.g., `VRCritic_shaffer1_dcermak2.pdf`).
