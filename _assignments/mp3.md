## Depth Perception and Relative Size

In the provided scene, the `StimulusManager` object has three spherical children.
Put the red sphere at position `( 0, 0, -2.3)` and the two blue spheres at positions `(0.7, 0, -1.6)`, `(-0.8, 0, -1)`, respectively.

Create a script called `GenerateStimuli` that dynamically changes the sizes of the two blue spheres so that
no matter what the position and orientation of the camera are,
the blue spheres always “appear” to be at the same depth as the red sphere with respect to their retinal image sizes (reference: [sec. 6.1.1](http://vr.cs.uiuc.edu/vrch6.pdf)).
That is, we ask you to vary the sizes of the blue spheres
so that the _rendered_ images of all of the three spheres have equal diameters when viewed on the Oculus Rift display.

You are only allowed to change the sizes of the blue spheres to complete this task.
You must not change the positions of the three spheres, nor the size of the red sphere.

You must add a control for a button that makes the spheres appear or disappear. The red sphere must [dis]appear immediately after the user presses the button, and the two blue spheres must [dis]appear exactly two seconds after the red sphere [dis]appears. You can assume that the user will not press `S` again within the two seconds. The spheres should initially be invisible, and the `GenerateStimuli` script should permanently activate when the user presses the S key for the first time.

Even after you complete this exercise, you will still easily infer the relative depth between the three spheres,
because there are many depth cues other than retinal image size that help you perceive depth accurately.
Therefore, this exercise will not create an illusion of the spheres being placed at equal distances from your eyes.
You will learn more about optical illusions and depth perception later in class.

## Disabling Tracking

The Oculus software automatically sets the camera's `Transform` based on the headset's position and rotation tracking.
In this task, you must counteract that tracking, i.e. the net effect is as though tracking was disabled.
This should help you understand how much tracking contributes towards a feeling of presence in VR.

Create a script named `ToggleTracking` that turns tracking on and off.
You must add controls for two separate buttons to disable position and rotation tracking, independently of each other.
Note that simultaneously disabling rotation and position tracking counts as extra credit.
If you attempt this, make a note in your README file.

A bad solution is to put all `GameObject`s as children of the camera.
This depends on the hierarchy structure of Unity and causes performance issues, so we will not accept it.
We want you to think about how to counteract the effects of position and rotation tracking using transformations.

Please remember to tell us what your control scheme is.
