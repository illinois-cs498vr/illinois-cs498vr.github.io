You will review three VR experiences according to the [Oculus Best Practices Guide](https://developer.oculus.com/design/latest/concepts/book-bp/). These VR experiences can be from the Oculus Store, the Steam Store, or a student demo from the CS498 `V:` drive (in the "Student Projects" folder). There is no right or wrong answer. This assignment is meant to turn you into a VR snob; pick apart every little design decision you can think of.

Each review must focus on the following four categories:
1. Graphical/Aesthetic Quality
1. User interface
1. Movement
1. Immersion/Presence

For each category, write a short paragraph that describes what that particular VR experience does well and what it does poorly in regards to that category. In each review, include at least two suggestions on how to improve the experience. Make sure to back up your critiques and suggestions with evidence from the Best Practices Guide (See Citation). In total, write 150-300 words per review.

### Grading

*You will be graded according to how well you can justify your answer with specific examples from the Oculus Best Practices Guide.*

### Citation
**You must provide section names and direct quotes from the Best Practices Guide to cite a given obsevation.**

Example:
> The menu feels too close to the eyes which may cause discomfort.  Instead, UI elements should be incorporated into the virtual world as 3D objects. [1]

In footnotes:
> [1] Vision -> Comfortable Viewing Distances: ...should be rendered at least 0.5 meters away...


### Submission
Submit your reviews on Compass as a double-spaced PDF. The filename should contain the NetIDs of everyone in the group separated by underscores (e.g., `MP3_shaffer1_dcermak2.pdf`).
